Pcap capture folder containing traffic capture files for normal and attack traces

To produce traces :

1. Run tcpdump capture script :
ex. sudo tcpdump -AUq -i enp0s8 port 56300 or port 1700 -w pulldataflooding.pcap

2. Run LWN Simulator via Web GUI :

3. Wait for Join Procedure and some data exchange to complete & Run attack script :
sudo python3 attack_script.py XXXXXX : ( XXXXX = number of packets to send to target )

In script set source and destination IP and port , payload , Transmission Delay.

4. Monitor LWN Simulator logs on Web GUI & Chirpstack Console

Wait for normal conditions to return after launching attack script

5. Stop LWN Simulator 

6. Stop tcpdump capture




To produce graphs of on wireshark

1. Statistics --> I/O Graphs


To get a visual representation of flows between systems

2. Statistics --> Flow Graphs


To get statistics for each capture 

3. Statistics --> Conversations


To extract payload for replay attack

4. Right click on packet --> Follow --> UDP Streams --> Show data as Raw/Hex Dump / ASCII --> Copy corresponding Raw payload to script
