Creating a master's thesis on practical DOS (Denial of Service) attacks on a simulated LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) network requires a comprehensive structure that covers all the necessary aspects of your research. Here's a suggested structure:

Title Page: Contains the title of your thesis, your name, your advisor's name, the university name, and the date.

Abstract: A concise summary of your thesis, including the problem statement, methodology, results, and conclusion.

Acknowledgements: Optional section to thank people or institutions that helped you during your research.

Table of Contents: A list of the chapters, sections, and subsections along with page numbers.

List of Figures/Tables: If your thesis contains figures or tables, list them here with their corresponding page numbers.

Chapter 1 - Introduction: Overview of your research topic, the problem statement, the purpose of the study, and your research questions.

Chapter 2 - Background and Literature Review: Detailed background on LoRaWAN technology, its vulnerability to DOS attacks, and a review of existing literature on the topic.

Chapter 3 - Methodology: Description of your research methodology. This should include details on the simulation environment, the DOS attack methods you'll be testing, and how you'll be measuring the impacts of these attacks.

Chapter 4 - Implementation: Detailed explanation of how you've set up your simulated LoRaWAN network, and how you've implemented the DOS attacks. Include all necessary diagrams, code snippets, and configurations.

Chapter 5 - Results and Discussion: Presentation of your results (possibly with tables, charts, etc.), followed by a discussion interpreting these results. You might discuss the effectiveness of different types of DOS attacks, the vulnerability of LoRaWAN networks, and how your results compare to those from other studies.

Chapter 6 - Mitigation Strategies: Discussion of possible mitigation strategies or defensive techniques to prevent or reduce the impact of DOS attacks on LoRaWAN networks.

Chapter 7 - Conclusion: Summary of your findings, their implications, and suggestions for future research.

References: Cite all the sources you've used in your thesis.

Appendices: Include any additional information here (for example, detailed code, additional data, etc.).
